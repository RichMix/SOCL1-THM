# What is MITRE ATT&CK Matrix?
MITRE ATT&CK Matrix is a visualization method used to classify and see attack methods of cyber attackers. 
Matrices can be customized for almost any subject and turned into useful visuals. 
MITRE has created MITRE ATT&CK matrices to visualize the details of attacker behavior using the matrices.

# Types of Matrices
3 different matrices have been created within the MITRE ATT&CK Framework according to the platform types:

# Enterprise Matrix
Mobile Matrix
ICS (Industrial Control Systems) Matrix

Enterprise Matrix

Enterprise matrix is the first matrix created by MITRE. 
There are more digital systems included in this matrix and are more common than those that are included in other matrices, so there are a lot more information in this matrix than other matrices. 
Enterprise matrix is mainly used to understand the cyber attacks on large organizations.

The following image shows the enterprise matrix in detail:

There are 7 sub-matrices under the Enterprise Matrix:

PRE
Windows
macOS
Linux
Cloud
Network
Containers
You can access the Enterprise Matrix and its sub-matrices at the following link and can learn more about them:

Mobile Matrix

The mobile matrix is the one that was prepared for mobile devices and contains information about the cyber security of mobile devices. 
This matrix can be used to ensure the security of individual and corporate mobile devices. Comparing the Enterprise Matrix, it contains less information:

Mobile Matrix has 2 sub-matrices:

Android
iOS

ICS Matrix

The ICS Matrix is the one that contains the information collected for the cyber security of devices in the industrial control systems. 
This matrix can be used to provide cyber security and analyses of an ICS.

We have covered the MITRE ATT&CK matrices in this part of the training. 
We have explained what the MITRE ATT&CK matrix is, type of matrices their sub-types. 
In the next part of the training, the subject of “Tactics” within the matrices is explained.
