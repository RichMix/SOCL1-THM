# Malware Definition and Malware Types
The word Malware is a word derived from the words MALicious softWARE. 
It is the name given to software that endangers the security and integrity of systems by targeting a malicious purpose.

Today, cyber threat actors use malicious software to achieve various purposes such as ensuring persistence, damaging systems, demanding ransom. 
As SOC analyst, we need to analyze suspicious software and understand whether the software is really harmful.

Since there is no restriction, you can come across malicious software written in almost all programming languages. 
You don't need to know all programming languages ​​to start analyzing malware. 
However, we can say that being familiar with programming makes it easy to analyze malicious software (it is even mandatory in matters such as reverse engineering).

With each passing day, we see that cyber threat actors develop themselves and develop more complex malware. 
Attackers now use various methods to make analysis of their malicious software even more difficult. 
Since these methods are at an advanced level, they will not be explained in the "Malware Fundamentals" training, and a special training will be prepared for these methods.

In this process, we must constantly improve ourselves in order to be prepared for current threats.

As a SOC analyst, you will encounter many suspicious files in your daily work routine. 
These files may have come via email, or may have been detected by the antivirus software on the user device, or they may have been detected by the network security products while being transferred. 

As a result of the analysis, you will be able to find whether the file is harmful or not; and its purpose if it is harmful, the command and control servers and the type of the malware.

## How Malware Analysis Help SOC Analysts
Have you ever heard of Stuxnet before? The US and Israeli intelligence services created Stuxnet to disrupt Iran's nuclear work. 
This malware, which was first detected in 2010, still has a complex structure even today. 
Although it contains many zero-day vulnerabilities, it provides propagation with USB devices. 
This malware damaged Iran’s Natanz uranium enrichment plants and caused it to be closed permanently.

As you can see in the Stuxnet example, even if you are not very close to technology in your life, the impact of malware on our lives is quite high.

What about the importance of malwares in SOC for a person who wants to be a security analyst?

When you examine the work routine of a standard Security Analyst, you will see that the analysts frequently encounter suspicious files or processes. 
Considering that malware is used in the vast majority of cyber attacks, you can understand that this information is not unusual.

As a Security Analyst, you should be able to analyze and figure out whether these files are harmful; and, if it is malicious, you should understand the purpose of this software and how it communicates with the command and control servers. 
It is an undeniable fact that malware analysis is an indispensable know-how for Security Analysts.

Many malware analysis methods and techniques are available to examine suspicious files. 
In this training series, you can analyze malware using the most appropriate technique for your needs.

### Malware Types
Although the names of the command and control servers and the methods they use vary, the purposes of malicious software are within certain categories. 
In this way, you can inform the other person about what the malware is doing by simply telling the category of the malware.

For example, if you say that the software you are examining is a keylogger, everyone will know that this is a software that records and plays the keys pressed on the keyboard. You may provide this important initial information about the malware to your upper management to give the idea about it and the attacker's target then follow up with the detailed analysis report.

As we mentioned, malicious software are divided into types according to their functions/purposes/characters. After analyzing the malware, you will match it with one of the following types. Therefore, you should know what these types are.

#### Some types of malware and their descriptions are as follows:

- Backdoor: Leaving a backdoor on the device where the malware is installed, it allows the attacker to access the system through this backdoor. 
For example, by opening a network port connected to the shell, it enables the attacker to connect to the system through this port.
- Adware: It often comes with downloaded software, causing unwanted advertisements to be displayed on the device. 
While not all adware is harmful, some change the default search engine.
- Ransomware: It is a type of malware that has been on the world agenda for the last few years. It demands ransom from people by encrypting and exfiltrating all files on the device.
- Virus: It is one of the first types of malware seen in the wild. So we see that in daily life, it is often called a virus instead of the term malware. Viruses have a self-replicate feature. It provides persistence by infecting other files on the device.
- Worm: Since this type of malware spreads from infected devices to other devices, it is named worm. WannaCry, a worm malware exploiting MS17-010 vulnerability, caused panic around the world.
- Rootkit: It is a type of malware that disguises itself by providing access to a high level of authority on the device.
- RAT (Remote Access Trojan): It is a type of malware that provides full control over the device to the threat actor.
- Banking malware: A type of malware that targets banking applications and causes money to be stolen from the victim.
- Keylogger: A type of malware that logs pushed keys and sends this information to attacker.


A malware may contain more than one feature, so a malware can belong to more than one type. 
For example, WannaCry malware includes both worm and ransomware malware features.
